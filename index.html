    <h3>I'm Jack Shan, I live in Melbourne and I do things.</h3>
      <p>I don't actually know what to write in this section so i'm just going to copy and paste biggie lyrics for the rest of this section.
        It was all a dream
        I used to read Word Up magazine
        Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
        Hangin pictures on my wall
        Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
        I let my tape rock til my tape popped
        Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
        Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
        With the hat to match
        Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
        You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
        Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
        Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
        Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
        Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
        Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
        Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
        I'm blowin up like you thought I would
        Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
        It's all good (it's aaalll good)
        And if you don't know, now you know, nigga.
